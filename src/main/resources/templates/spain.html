This region of Spain is known for its rugged beauty and great food, as you'll experience on a visit to the cities of Bilbao and San Sebastian.</p>

After unpacking you'll hit the streets with an expert guide for a city tour. There's a lot to enjoy about Basque culture here, not least of which is the incredible food. To that end, this tour combines the culinary offerings of the Spanish Basque Country with the highlights of Bilbao.

                                                        On this walking tour, you'll visit the city's historic Casco Viejo ("old quarter"). Bilbao is located near the estuary of the River Nervión, and the Casco Viejo is right on the waterfront. This is a pedestrian area filled with colorful old buildings, cafés, bars, markets, and boutiques.

                                                        In the heart of Casco Viejo, in fact, are Las Siete Calles, the original "seven streets" of the city, which date back to the 1400s. As you stroll the cobbled streets, you'll visit emblematic buildings such as the 14th-century Bilbao Cathedral, the Plaza Nueva (New Square), the 16th-century Church of Saint Anthony and the Mercado de la Ribera (Seaside Market), the largest covered market in Europe.

                                                        This guided tour focuses as much on the architecture of the museum as it does the exhibits inside. The building itself is a contemporary masterpiece designed by the legendary Frank Gehry— a glimmering titanium structure that looks like a sculpture, with sleek lines sensually curving in seeming defiance of physics. Inside, the museum's 24,000 square-meter space houses a treasure trove of works from great artists such as Andy Warhol, Anish Kapoor, Jeff Koons, Louise Bourgeois, and Eduardo Chillida.</p>

                                                    <p data-animation="fadeInUp" data-delay=".5s">In the morning you'll leave Bilbao for San Sebastian. While it's only an hour drive from one city to the other, the Basque coast is too stunning to rush. We've therefore turned this journey into a full-day tour that begins when you meet a personal driver/guide and head off from Bilbao for the wild Cantabrian Coast.
                                                        Your first stop is the islet of Gaztelugatxe, perched atop which is a hermitage dating back to the 11th century. This little island is most noteworthy for the long stone bridge that connects it to the mainland. Game of Thrones fans will recognize it as the filming location for Dragonstone, which was featured in season seven.From Gaztelugatxe, you'll continue driving a few minutes along the coast to the colorful fishing village of Bermeo. Not only is this the Basque region's most important fishing port, but it's also located at the edge of Urdaibai, a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve and protected area home to some of Spain's most gorgeous coastal landscapes. From Bermeo, you'll travel a couple of miles deeper into Urdaibai to the town of Mundaka, which sits on an estuary home to magnificent wetlands.
                                                        At this point, you'll drive a short way to the Gorka Izagirre winery, which boasts the largest txakolí wine cellar in Basque Country. This local white wine pairs perfectly with the delectable fish and shellfish of the region, and you'll discover its white fruit and floral notes on a tasting tour. Then you'll head just up the hill to an adjacent Michelin-starred restaurant where you'll sit down to an elaborate gourmet tasting menu with wine pairings.
                                                        After the meal, you and your driver will continue east to San Sebastian. Upon arrival, you'll check into your hotel and can spend the remainder of the day at leisure.</p>

                                                    <p data-animation="fadeInUp" data-delay=".5s">In the morning you'll meet a private guide and enjoy a four-hour tour of San Sebastian. It begins in the famous Old Town, which is situated in the east of San Sebastian between the ocean and the River Urumea. You'll stroll around the neighborhood, stopping at pintxos bars and cafés as you go.
                                                        At the edge of Old Town is the iconic San Sebastian City Hall. Constructed in 1887, it used to be the Gran Casino during the Belle Époque period until it was closed in 1924. The building still overlooks the bay, where an elegant promenade with railings and street lamps runs along the crescent-shaped La Concha Beach.
                                                        For great views, you and your guide can take a ferry to the iconic offshore island of Santa Clara, or ride a funicular up to Mont Igualdo, which offers sweeping panoramas. You might also stroll the banks of the Urumea River, where you'll find the 19th-century Victoria Eugenia Theatre, the palatial Maria Cristina Hotel, and many aristocratic houses dating to the turn of the 20th century. You can get some good pictures walking across the Puente María Cristina, the bridge that crosses the river.
                                                        After the tour, you'll return to your hotel and can spend the remainder of the day however you see fit. Once the sun goes down, however, you'll likely want to head back out and indulge in San Sebastian's famous dining scene.</p>

Depending on the time of your flight or train reservation, squeeze in one more morning of sight-seeing, perhaps picking up some last-minute souvenirs. At the designated time you will be picked up at your hotel and transferred to the airport or rail station for your departure onwards.
