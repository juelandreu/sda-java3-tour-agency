This is nature at its dramatic and visual best.  Deep blue seas are contrasted by rugged coastlines, plunging cliffs, golden sand beaches, and isolated coves. The human touch is equally attractive with characteristic “sugar-cube” architecture, blue-domed churches, white-washed monasteries, photogenic windmills, and crumbling fortresses.  History has left a footprint as well, providing ancient archaeological sites to be explored.</p>

The picturesque Chora (main village) is also the island’s main port. Windmills on the hill, whitewashed houses, and blue-domed churches welcome you to the Cyclades. The Chora is noisy at night. Therefore, our tour hotel is a 15 minute walk from town (and very close to the airport), overlooking sweeping Magali Ammos Beach, allowing us both access and peaceful separation. We'll gather in the early evening for our welcome meeting followed by dinner together.

The rest of your day is free to further explore the Chora or the island, take an excursion, or relax on the beach or by our hotel’s infinity pool. If our group reaches 20 people, we will add a coach tour of the rest of the island. Dinner together in a taverna.

Delos was the birthplace of Apollo and the seat of the Delian League in ancient times. Today the island hosts the best Greek ruins in the Aegean. We will explore its many secrets with Antonis. Your afternoon is again free.</p>

Often overlooked for more famous neighbors, Naxos boasts a storied history, reflected in Venetian and Frankish archeological sites, and a beautiful and varied landscape of mountains, valleys, and beaches. Naxos is famously the greenest of the Cyclades. After settling into our hotel we’ll embark on an orientation of the Chora, finishing up with dinner in a taverna. During dinner we’ll enjoy live Greek music and, after dinner, a demonstration of Greek dancing.

On our excursion we will visit the Portara, the remaining gate of the 6th century BC Temple of Apollo; the villages of Halki, Vivlos, & Filoti; Mount Zeus (highest in the Cyclades); the Kouros of Apollonas (huge, unfinished marble statue); and many scenic vistas.</p>

The crescent shaped island boasts steep cliffs, dramatic volcanic caldera views, blue-domed churches, classic Cycladic sugar cube architecture, and the most beautiful sunsets to be found anywhere. Like Mykonos, Santorini is heavily touristed so we are staying outside of the bustling Thira town in our caldera-clinging 4 star resort.

Escorted by our ace local guide Eugenia, we will visit Akrotiri (exceptional Minoan civilization ruins); a red sand beach; a lunch break on Kamari Beach (swimming available); one of the islands colorful villages; and spectacular Oia with the best views on the island. We’ll conclude our afternoon with wine tasting at a caldera view winery and then move on to a final taverna dinner together.</p>
                                                    <p data-animation="fadeInUp" data-delay=".5s">Day 9</p>

Use the free hotel shuttle to visit Thira for shopping or exploring. Relax on a black sand beach or one of our hotel’s 3 swimming pools. We’ll gather for Happy Hour and toast our many adventures and new memories.</p>
